"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10104.001"
"Name: Soil microbe biomass"
"Description: Quantitative abundance of total microbes in soil samples"
"NEON Science Team Supplier: TOS"
"Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled laboratory data and metadata for microbial biomass derived from soil microbial sampling. Microbial biomass is measured by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, in which a set of microbial lipid biomarkers is extracted and quantified using either Gas Chromatography (GC) or Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GS-MS).  For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage."
"Latency:"
"The expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information."
"sme_batchResults:  14"
"sme_labSummary:  14"
"sme_microbialBiomass:  240"
"Brief Design Description: Three pre-determined, randomly assigned locations are selected for each sampling event within each of 10 plots distributed throughout a site; sampling locations within a plot are not re-sampled. Sampling occurs at each site once every five years, with a frequency of one to three times within the sampling year (depending on length of growing season), with all sites sampling during the historic peak in vegetation greenness. Soil samples are collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm, with organic and mineral soils sampled separately. Bulk samples are homogenized in the field. A subset of the soil is either sieved (mineral soils), or picked of coarse debris such as rocks, roots and organic material (organic soils) and 5-10g are"
"Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial sites."
"Keywords: fungi, function, phospholipid fatty acid (PFLA), soil, microbes, bacteria, abundance, biomass"
"DATA PACKAGE CONTENTS"
"---------------------"
"This data product contains up to 3 data tables:"
"sme_microbialBiomass - Laboratory results of microbial biomass data"
"sme_batchResults - Microbial biomass batch-level data"
"sme_labSummary - Long-term uncertainty values for soil microbial biomass analysis"
"If data are unavailable for the particular sites and dates queried, some tables may be absent."

"Expanded download package definition: The expanded packaged includes two additional summary data tables. One table provides batch-level metadata for a set of samples analyzed in the same batch. The second table provides long-term precision and accuracy metadata on the methods and instrumentation."
"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON observational systems (OS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."
"DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."
"YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file."
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
"Time stamp conventions:"
"YYYY: Year"
"YY: Year, last two digits only"
"MM: Month: 01-12"
"DD: Day: 01-31"
"T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning"
"HH: Hours: 00-23"
"mm: Minutes: 00-59"
"SS: Seconds: 00-59"
"Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC"

"Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier."
"CHANGE LOG"
"----------"
"ADDITIONAL REMARKS"
"------------------"
"Queries for the basic package of this data product will return data from `sme_microbialBiomass` for all dates within the specified date range. Queries for the expanded package will also return data from all dates for `sme_batchResults` and `sme_labSummary`. A given biomassID for sme_microbialBiomass is expected to generate one record. The `sme_microbialBiomass` table can be joined to other soil sampling data via the sampleID field, which matches the sampleID in `sls_soilCoreCollection`, in the Soil physical properties (Distributed periodic) data product. Duplicate samples and/or missing data may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables."

"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."
""
"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every"
